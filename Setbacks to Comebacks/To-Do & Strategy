Goal:
    - Instead of just written quotes line by line, i think it's better to show the QUOTE IMAGES in like attractive picture bits with good backgrounds
Ogilvy i already got 8 quote pictures
i have to do that for all the others
mgiht be a good idea to copy it from In2 collection view library that i was using from cocoapods

The individual detail profiles should include
- Biography
- Quotes by the person ... using some other Quotes API ... can this be done?


- For now, just gonna do FAVORITES first


1) Data collection and Building out the UI could be done at the same time
    - Keep the skeleton SIMPLE AND FAST in the beginning
    - You can always add more UI later

2) First step is to build out the skeleton of TableView -> Detail View Architecture
    - + Ability to share on email/facebook
    - + Ability to favorite

3) Second step is to build out the "Favorites" section

4) Last but not least is to make it visually and aesthetically appealing by applying appropriate, cool UI effects out there that I can integrate into the project

Notes
- I realized that I should make the "biographies" and people information download from an API so that I can easily manipulate the data at will
        - if it comes bundled within the app, I won't be able to update or change anything real-time. It will be FIXED at time of submit to Apple and it will be a pain in the ass to update
        - Gotta upload all Biographies data INTO THE CLOUD

- Getting quotes manually will take time.
    - Wait ... I have my OWN API ... let's just use that
        - http://terrysquotes.herokuapp.com
        - Hopefully it can handle a lot of traffic.
    - WOOO RAILS AGAIN WOO EXCITED COME BACK TO ME RUBY AND RAILS I MISSED YOU
