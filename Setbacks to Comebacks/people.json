     "bio" : "Thomas Alva Edison (February 11, 1847 – October 18, 1931) was an American inventor and businessman, who has been described as America's greatest inventor. He developed many devices that greatly influenced life around the world, including the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and the long-lasting, practical electric light bulb. Dubbed 'The Wizard of Menlo Park' he was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of mass production and large-scale teamwork to the process of invention, and because of that, he is often credited with the creation of the first industrial research laboratory. In 1854, the family moved to Port Huron, Michigan, where Edison attended public school for a total of 12 weeks. A hyperactive child, prone to distraction, he was deemed 'mentally deficient' by his teacher. His mother quickly pulled him from school and taught him at home. At age 11, he showed a voracious appetite for knowledge, reading books on a wide range of subjects. In this wide-open curriculum Edison developed a process for self-education and learning independently that would serve him throughout his life. At age 12, Edison set out to put much of that education to work. He convinced his parents to let him sell newspapers to passengers along the Grand Trunk Railroad line. Exploiting his access to the news bulletins teletyped to the station office each day, Thomas began publishing his own small newspaper, called the Grand Trunk Herald. The up-to-date articles were a hit with passengers. This was the first of what would become a long string of entrepreneurial ventures where he saw a need and capitalized on opportunity. While he worked for the railroad, a near-tragic event turned fortuitous for the young man. After Edison saved a 3-year-old from being run over by an errant train, the child’s grateful father rewarded him by teaching him to operate a telegraph. By age 15, he had learned enough to be employed as a telegraph operator. For the next five years, Edison traveled throughout the Midwest as an itinerant telegrapher, subbing for those who had gone to the Civil War. In his spare time, he read widely, studied and experimented with telegraph technology, and became familiar with electrical science. And the rest is history ... Today, there's many places named after Thomas Edison, one of them being a town in New Jersey named called Edison in New Jersey.",

After this experience, Jesus performed miracles, healed the sick and gained a tremendous following. Jesus was then persecuted by authories who charged him for blasphemy, then was betrayed by one of his disciples, Judah, who sold him for 30 pieces of silver. Jesus was then famously nailed to the cross, and his disciples, although deeply saddened by this loss, decided to continue on the fire of his legacy by preaching his teachings all over the world, generation after generation.

According to several reports, Stallone refused to sell the script unless he was allowed to star in it. Despite having a pregnant wife and little money in the bank, he held out until he found two producers, Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff, willing to let him play the lead.",

A class clown in school and a community theater actor in his teens, Pryor became a successful stand-up comedian, television writer and movie actor. His mother reportedly worked as a prostitute and his father was a bartender and boxer who served in the military during World War II. In 1963, Pryor moved to New York City to pursue comedy. Fans of all racial backgrounds were captivated by Pryor's comedy, which consisted of situational and character-driven humor in place of straightforward jokes. He poked fun at the white establishment and explored the racial divide. Pryor became the first person to receive the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor from the Kennedy Center in 1998. He said at the time, 'I am proud that, like Mark Twain, I have been able to use humor to lessen people's hatred.' Pryor paved the way for African-American comedians like Eddie Murphy and Chris Rock to make their mark. 'Pryor started it all. He made the blueprint for the progressive thinking of black comedians, unlocking that irreverent style,' comedian and filmmaker Keenen Ivory Wayans explained to The New York Times. ",

He was born on December 5, 1901, in Hermosa, Illinois. His father was Elias Disney, an Irish-Canadian, and his mother, Flora Call Disney, was German-American. Disney was one of five children, four boys and a girl. He lived most of his childhood in Marceline, Missouri, where he began drawing, painting and selling pictures to neighbors and family friends. In 1911, his family moved to Kansas City, where Disney developed a love for trains. His uncle, Mike Martin, was a train engineer who worked the route between Fort Madison, Iowa and Marceline. Later, Disney would work a summer job with the railroad, selling snacks and newspapers to travelers. Disney dropped out of High School at 16 years old. He and his brother Roy co-founded Walt Disney Productions, which became one of the best-known motion-picture production companies in the world. Disney was an innovative animator and created the cartoon character Mickey Mouse. Walt Disney was also another boy brought up in a farm – and used to draw pictures for his neighbors for money. Disney went through a jobless phase where no one hired him, and his brother had to help him out with his job search. He went from rags to riches by starting out with advertisements and going on to animating his own cartoons. Disney attended McKinley High School in Chicago, where he took drawing and photography classes and was a contributing cartoonist for the school paper. At night, he took courses at the Chicago Art Institute.",

He attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel hill and then was drafted out of his Junior year to join the NBA. He led the Chicago Bulls to six NBA championships and won the Most Valuable Player Award five times. Growing up in Wilmington, North Carolina, Jordan developed a competitive edge at an early age. He wanted to win every game he played. As his father James later noted, 'What he does have is a competition problem. He was born with that ... the person he tries to outdo most of the time is himself.' In 1978, Michael Jordan was just another kid in the gym, along with 50 or so of his classmates, trying out for the Emsley A. Laney High School varsity basketball team. There were 15 roster spots. Jordan—then a 15-year-old sophomore who was only 5'10. 'It was embarrassing not making the team,' Jordan later said. He went home, locked himself in his room and cried. Then he picked himself up and turned the cut into motivation. 'Whenever I was working out and got tired and ﬁgured I ought to stop, I’d close my eyes and see that list in the locker room without my name on it,' Jordan would explain. 'That usually got me going again.' Jordan, using that sizable chip on his shoulder to his advantage, spent his sophomore year as the star of the junior varsity team. He put up multiple 40-point games and attracted crowds that were unprecedented for a JV affair. The summer leading into his junior year,  Jordan began to morph. In 1979 he grew 4 inches and worked out constantly. That year he made the varsity squad and instantly became Laney High’s best player, averaging more than 20 points a game.",

Coelho eventually got out of institutional care and enrolled in law school, but dropped out to indulge in the 'sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll' of hippie life in the 1970s. He wrote song lyrics for Brazilian musicians protesting the country's military rule. He was jailed three times for his political activism and subjected to torture in prison.When Coelho was 38 years old, he had a spiritual awakening in Spain. In 1987, Coelho wrote a new book, The Alchemist, over the course of one two-week spurt of creativity. The allegorical novel was about an Andalusian shepherd boy who follows a mystical trek in which he learns to speak the 'Language of the World' and thus receives his heart's desire. The book attracted little attention at first, until a French-language translation suddenly leapt onto bestseller lists in France in the early 1990s. New translations followed, and soon The Alchemist became a worldwide phenomenon. The book has sold, by Coelho's count, roughly 35 million copies, and is now the most translated book in the world by any living author. ",

Hawking was the first to set forth a theory of cosmology explained by a union of the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics. He is a vigorous supporter of the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.
